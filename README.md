# TDBackend
## About:

TriDubai is a triathlon community founded to serve triathletes of all abilities in Dubai.

We aim to support triathletes: from complete beginners to world-class athletes; for those training for sprint distance to Ironman races (or just training for the love of it); for those starting out, starting again or wanting to break records.

TriDubai welcomes new members. We want to encourage anyone who is keen to try triathlon – even if you have never done anything like it before. Our ethos is one of inclusivity and enjoyment – we want to help people get the most out of the sport, but have lots of fun in the process.

We get together for training sessions. These are led by TriDubai members who volunteer their time. The training sessions are inclusive and for all abilities – and are also completely free of charge.  Confirmation of each session gets put up on our facebook group (which is also full of chat about all things triathlon).

Sound good? Then please get involved and follow us on social media!
